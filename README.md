## Why Commudle?
There are about 26.4 million software developers in the world. And that's just the estimate for professionals.
And one of the huge sources of motivation and learning for these Developers is Tech Communities in their region, and beyond. Commudle is a platform to provide for all these Communities and Developers. We aim to provide a platform where all the amazing content, ranging from slides, to sessions (even links to those) are all at one place. We want to know what those amazing side projects you have built, even if it's yet to be given those finishing touches.
