          What's up!
        </p>
        <p>
          There are about 26.4 million software developers in the world. And that's just the estimate for
          professionals.
          <br>
          And one of the huge sources of motivation and learning for these Developers is
          <strong>Tech Communities</strong> in their region, and beyond. Commudle is a platform to provide for all
          these Communities and Developers. We aim to provide a platform where all the amazing content, ranging
          from slides, to sessions (even links to those) are all at one place. We want to know what those
          amazing side projects you have built, even if it's yet to be given those finishing touches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beginning with features to manage your Tech Community, we aim to create the world's largest platform
          built for Techies, by Techies.
        </p>

        <p>Today, Commudle is having 3 main verticals, viz. <strong>
          <a class="clickable" [routerLink]="['/communities']">Communities</a>,
          <a class="clickable" [routerLink]="['/labs']">Labs</a>
          and
          <a class="clickable" [routerLink]="['/builds']">Builds</a>
        </strong>. Each of these is a step towards helping the Developers of these Communities, from
        managing the communities, creating tutorials, to recognizing the amazing things people are building.
